# **Crowdfunding Data Analysis**

## **Overview**
Crowdfunding is one of the fastest emerging online industries. It is a platform where budding entrepreneurs present their innovative ideas and raise funds for their projects. There are many factors that affect the success rate of a project in a crowdfunding campaign, such as the type of project, country of origin, the feasibility of the project, marketing and so on. Therefore, it is indeed essential to perform in-depth research on the success rate of a project, before going online.
A dataset with 1000 sample projects was used to unveil any hidden trends. The dataset contain the following columns:Id, name, blurb, goal, pledged, outcome, backers count, country, currency, launched at, deadline, staff pick, spotlight, category and subcategory

# **Limitations of the dataset:**
Though the dataset provided sufficient information, there are details which if had been provided, a better analysis would have been performed.
* This dataset does not provide any insights on the review ratings of the project (such as online project presentation) on social media, for instance Facebook, twitter. Reviews, comments and shares on social media could be used to determine the public interest in a project, which is very likely a determining factor for success.
* The dataset does not provide any information on the duration a campaign took to reach its fund goals. That would have provided more insights into the success rate of a campaign. 
* The dataset provided seems to be reward based crowdfunding. However, no information is provided about the rewards /perks given in return for the donation.

# **Possible tables and/or graphs**
* In addition to the plotted graphs, we could have created a histogram plot for the statistical analysis table. This would have helped us to understand the nature of the data, that is, whether the data is a normal distribution or right or left skewed distribution.
* In the “Monthly analysis of outcome” graph, we could have added ‘country’ as a filter so that we can analyze how the trend varies with country too.
* A table and a graph could also have been created with the campaign length and outcome, to analyze whether the campaign length affects the success rate of a project.

# **Statistical Analysis**
* For the dataset, the median better summarizes the data than mean, because the data seems to be right skewed as for the right skewed distribution, the mean (851.15, 585.62 for successful campaign and unsuccessful campaign respectively)is greater than median(201,114.50 for successful and unsuccessful campaigns respectively). 

* From data, it is understood that there is variability with both successful as well as unsuccessful campaigns. However, it is difficult to determine which has more, since there are campaigns that had less backers, but it succeeded. Similarly, there were campaigns that had more backers, but it failed. Success of a project depends on many factors such as type of project, feasibility of the project, project exposure, campaign length to name a few. The given data is insufficient to consider all these aspects.   

# **Conclusions**
Based on the analysis, the following conclusions were drawn about crowdfunding campaigns: -
* In addition to many other factors, category plays a vital role in deciding the success rate of a campaign. From the “Monthly Analysis of Outcome” graph, it can be interpreted that Technology has always seen a high success rate, followed by music and journalism. Therefore, it is advisable for entrepreneurs to come up with innovative ideas in these domains.
* Many of the crowdfunding campaigns are held in US (763 out of 1000), with theatre (plays) being the most successful category (149 successful outcome) for funding.
* The success or failure rate of a crowdfunding project is not determined by the number of backers or by the duration of funding alone.
